 ### Rick and Morty mini game
 
 # - This game will be based on the show Rick and Morty and one of their adventures.
 It will include some paths that can lead the user on an small adventure.
 The adventure will end completly based on what the users choices are.
 The game will loop to ask them if they would like to play the game again.
 
 ### This game will be about Rick an Morty's cronenberg episode where Rick accidentaly turn the world into cronenbergs.
 Cronenbergs are mutated humans essentially and are in a slug like state. I am changing the adventure up a bit, as they
 simply choose to go to another dimension instead of fixing the problem. I will be giving a few choices that are
 not in the episode.
 A few being:
 - Choosing another dimension and ignoring the problem and essentially ending the game
 - Choosing to find a cure and going on an adventure that will aid in finding a cure
