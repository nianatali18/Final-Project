# Final-Project-
 ### Rick and Morty mini game
 
 # - This game will be based on the show Rick and Morty and one of their adventures.
 It will include some paths that can lead the user on an small adventure.
 The adventure will end completly based on what the users choices are.
 The game will loop to ask them if they would like to play the game again.
 
 # Must meet this criteria given by the intructor 
- Your project code must be well structured using well-defined functions that perform one task and are clearly named.
- Your project should not use global variables. If you find yourself writing a global variable, you will need to justify - your decision.
- Your project must use at least one for or while loop.
- Your project must use Python's decision structure (if/elif/else).
- Your project must read and/or write to a file.
- Your project must make use of Python's data structures such as list, dictionary, set, etc.
- Your project must gracefully handle errors using try/except/else/finally.
- Your project must make use of at least one Python module that we have not previously used in class. You will have to research and learn how to use this module on your own. Some examples are:
  - Web scraping using Beautiful Soup, perhaps to get sports scores or e-sports team rankings
  - Image manipulation using Pillow, for example, to generate thumbnails for a folder of image files or to create random             images based on some input.
  - Natural language processing with spaCy.
  - Simple data science with NumPy, Matplotlib, and pandas; perhaps exploring some of the openly available data sets on   sites like kaggle.com or similar.
  - Write a program that will read a text file and produce a PDF using PyFPDF; the program should allow for the user to specify fonts, font size, color, etc. and images to be placed inline.
  - Write a program that pulls data from weather API and then builds a simple web page with the weather information including graphics for the forecast (openweathermap.org is a free site that will give you all you need for this project).

 
 ### This game will be about Rick an Morty's cronenberg episode where Rick accidentaly turn the world into cronenbergs.
 Cronenbergs are mutated humans essentially and are in a slug like state. I am changing the adventure up a bit, as they
 simply choose to go to another dimension and start over there instead of fixing the problem. I will be giving a few choices that are not in the episode.
 Two being:
 - Choosing another dimension and ignoring the problem and essentially ending the game and tells them the results of their choice and then asks if they would like to play again 
 - Choosing to find a cure and going on an adventure that will aid in finding a cure and will have them write their findings in a file each time they find something and at the end they can look back at the file to see what they found and their finding will link to the end and determine whether they live or die.
